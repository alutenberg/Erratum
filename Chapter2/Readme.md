### 2.3 Under the Hood 

After the book was printed we realized that the reader would benefit if more insight on serial communications protocols based on UARTs is provided in this section.
The following content should be read after reading the TIP that states:

> TIP: Sequences like the one shown in Figure 2.13 can be seen each time the NUCLEO board and the PC exchange messages by means of connecting an oscilloscope or a logic analyzer to the pins Tx and Rx of CN5, as shown in Figure 2.14. It is not explained here how to use oscilloscopes and logic analyzers because that topic is beyond the scope of this book.
